The underlying blockchain-anchored Zero Trust DePIN network is the only open, permissionless "ZTNA" available. It uses the $DIODE token to underwrite bandwidth supply on behalf of application providers. Anyone can create their own application on top of the Diode Network. As opposed to the rest of the ZTNA market, the Diode Network 1) has global routing and identities 2) is permissionless - anyone can contribute a routing / relay node 3) has no fees for using the network\* (using the network via third party relays requires a bandwidth sponsor).
