Diode's leading secure collaboration product is a cross-platform messaging application that feels like Slack but has a higher level of security posture than Signal.

It is made for team collaboration and communication in sensitive regions and in regulated data environments. The app also includes two other important features 1) an end-to-end encrypted file sharing capability - like Google Drive meets a secure self-custody bit torrent and 2) a VPN tunneling capability that allows the Zone owner to configure bookmarks that use regional-access tunnels (like consumer VPN) or direct-access tunnels (like Enterprise VPN).
