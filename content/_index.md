The <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/caxyvmjbem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Client</strong></a> (CLI) enables you to quickly publish content to the Diode Network, or to directly access content already published. It is a fast way to start interacting directly with the Diode Network from your local device. The Diode CLI implements the [**Blockquick(TM) algorithm**](https://support.diode.io/article/osywoqibv1), which enables anything running it to interact directly with compatible decentralized networks, like the Diode Network.
