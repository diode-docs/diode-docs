Diode's core capability is a next generation blockchain-enabled communications network.  The <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io" title="Diode Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Network</a> is sort of what it would be like if Signal were able to offer their E2EE infrastructure for anyone to build a new Signal app on top of.

The pioneer app on the Diode Network is our app - <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io" title="Diode App" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a next generation team messaging app</a>.  If you need to collaborate as a team, and either need or want secure communications and extensible integrations, this could be a great fit for you.  This is the first application of many that are being built, or [have been built](https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/projects), on the Diode Network.
