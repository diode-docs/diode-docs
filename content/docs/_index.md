> If you've already installed the app, you can just <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/updating-the-diode-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update it</a> without removing/uninstalling.

The main Diode application runs on all major platforms (MacOS, Linux-x86&ARM, Windows, iOS, Android).  It provides messaging, file-sync, and tunneled web access to Team Members who have been invited to collaborate in a Zone. All communication between peers is end to end encrypted, so the Diode Network and other Internet infrastructure never has access to any activity details or content.

Select the installation guide for your Operating System:
