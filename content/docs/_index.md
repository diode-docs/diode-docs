Anyone can run a Diode Network node (a Diode Point of Presence) and help expand the reach of the Diode Network.

It can take <a href="https://medium.com/@hansrempel_27543/first-deployment-of-a-diode-node-48c8a18f8e2d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than two minutes</a> to setup a node and start relaying traffic!

**Not convinced?** [Read here](/docs/faq/why-host-a-node/) for some reasons why you might want to run a node.
