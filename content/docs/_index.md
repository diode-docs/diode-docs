The main Diode application runs as a tray icon in MacOS, Windows, and Linux (x86 and ARM) and provides messaging, file-sync, and tunneled web access to Team Members who have been invited to collaborate in a Zone. All communication between peers is end to end encrypted, so the Diode Network and other Internet infrastructure never has access to any activity details or content.
