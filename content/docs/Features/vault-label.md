Each Vault has a label on the bottom of it with a QR code and its model number and serial number.

The Vault label looks like this:

![](https://files.helpdocs.io/qwk5dmv7m8/articles/1i6csk9xn4/1704228169963/image.png)

The model number is to the right of "M:" - in the label above, the model number is "2312-1T". See the <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/d0olggkxvi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Model Numbers</strong></a> article for information contained in the Model Number.

The serial number is to the right of "S:" - in the label above, the serial number is "23121212".

When you scan the QR code, it will take you to the <a href="https://diode.io/vaults/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vaults webpage</strong></a> and will show you the Username and Client ID of your Vault.

* If you cannot scan the QR code:
  * You can "figure out" the Username by combining the text "vault-" and the serial number shown to the right of "S:" on the label. For example, the above sticker's serial number is "23121212" so the Username would be "vault-231212".
  * You must contact support@diode.io with the model number and serial number to find its Client ID. The Client ID is only required for certain <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/1faeske6aa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>advanced capabilities</strong></a>.
