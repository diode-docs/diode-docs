##### **1\. Download**

[**Download Diode**](https://diode.io/resources/download) for Linux - pay attention to the Linux variant (x86, ARM, 32/64 bit) to ensure you download the right one for your system.

Set the File Permissions for the downloaded .run file to include "Execute".

You can then either run the installer from a terminal window (enter the name of the downloaded installer prececed by `./` - e.g. `./dDrive-1.8.12-linux-arm32.run`) or double click the file from the UI and select "Execute".
