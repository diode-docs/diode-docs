The Diode App has three types of plans that each Zone can subscribe to:

1. **Nomad** - The default free plan for individuals. We want to ensure individuals can achieve the basics of information self custody with the Nomad plan.
2. **Business** - A paid plan for teams who want to use the Diode App to enable their business operations.
3. **Enterprise** - This is a customizable plan for organizations who need to enable multiple teams, special features, limits, support, or billing arrangements. It is not a self-service plan, so please <a href="https://contactdiode.paperform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>contact us</strong></a> for Enterprise.

When a Zone is created, it automatically starts at the Nomad plan and can be upgraded to a higher plan via the Settings page. Here is a video demonstrating upgrading a Zone's plan:
