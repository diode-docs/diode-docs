The VPX-2402 model is a "Vault Lite" - it is primarily meant to operate as a self-custody private exit node.

There is only a single configuration of the VPX-2402 that uses a 32GB disk, a 1GHz processor, and 512MB of RAM.  It requires USB-C power and an Ethernet connection.

By pairing the Vault's Web3 identity to a Diode self-custody access Zone, you can use the Vault for remote access to the Internet from wherever the Vault is connected.
