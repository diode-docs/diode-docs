You can create a custom home page (aka About page) for your Zone to give Team Members immediate access to key information about the Zone. The home page becomes the default landing page when the Zone icon is clicked and when the Zone is opened from the task bar menu.

It can be viewed by any member if they click the "info" icon in the Zone's Quick Access bar:

### **Updating your Home Page**

Every Zone has a home page created by default.  If you are the Zone's owner or admin, you can click the "edit" icon to update its contents.

After you start editing, you can remove, modify, or add content and then save the file.

### **Turning a Home Page on or off**

If you want to disable the home page, an owner or admin can click the gear icon in the upper right:

That's it! Now when you, or any of your Team Members clicks your Zone's icon or otherwise opens the Zone, the first thing they'll see is your home page.
