Diode Collab supports Team Members of a few different Roles, as shown here:

| **Role** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Owners have all permissions in a Zone. |
| Admin | Admins have all the permissions of an Owner, but cannot transfer ownership to another user and cannot add or remove another Admin. |
| Member | Members cannot interact with most administrative settings, and cannot add or remove Team Members, Channels, or Bookmarks. |
| Read Only | Read Only team members cannot add or remove files, see any public/private Channels or Member DMs, or access any global Zone Settings. They can read files, can view the feed in Broadcast Channels, and can interact with Admins and Owner DMs. |
| Bot | Bots are the same as Members, but are not shown as Team Members in Channels. |

In order to manage the Role of a Team Member, follow the following steps:

* Use Diode as the Admin or Owner of the Zone for which you want to manage Team Member roles
