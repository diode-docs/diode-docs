The Diode app supports Team Members of a few different Roles, as shown here:

<table><thead><tr><th><p><strong>Role</strong></p></th><th><p><strong>Description</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Owner</p></td><td><p>Owners have all permissions in a Zone.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Admin</p></td><td><p>Admins have all the permissions of an Owner, but cannot transfer ownership to another user and cannot add or remove another Admin.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Member</p></td><td><p>Members cannot interact with most administrative settings, and cannot add or remove Team Members, Channels, or Bookmarks.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Read Only</p></td><td><p>Read Only team members cannot add or remove files, see any public/private Channels or Member DMs, or access any global Zone Settings. They can read files, can view the feed in Broadcast Channels, and can interact with Admins and Owner DMs.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bot</p></td><td><p>Bots are the same as Members, but are not shown as Team Members in Channels.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
