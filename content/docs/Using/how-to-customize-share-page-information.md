This article describes how to customize the appearance of the web page that is presented when people use a browser to access a file or folder that you've shared with them.

Every Diode Collab Zone is able to <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/using/share-a-file-or-folder-via-web-browser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>share files and folders</strong></a> with others who do not have Diode Collab installed. When a person clicks on the Web Link for the shared information, their web browser will open a website (the Zone's Share Page) that gives them access to the information that has been shared. If the Zone has the right <a href="https://app.docs.diode.io/docs/features/pricing-and-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>subscription plan</strong></a>, the Share Page branding can be customized by the Zone Owner or Admin.

For an example customized share page, look at this <a href="https://share.diode.link/drive-0nv3stp8bxmct2jzm0ng/an3ewd2tbhxzxuke" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>web link into the Acme File Sharing Portal</strong></a>.

The default Share Page branding is shown in the Zone's Settings page:

These settings can be edited to create a custom branded file sharing portal as shown below:
