Diode is an amalgamation of the terms “**D**istributed **I**nternet **O**f **DE**vices”

The <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network</strong></a> allows all sorts of apps/devices/systems - servers, routers, cell phones, laptops, Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, etc… - to communicate and interact in a fully decentralized manner. This is demonstrated by applications like <a href="https://diode.io/products/d-drive" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Drive</strong></a> and the <a href="https://cli.docs.diode.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode CLI</strong></a>, which incorporate the <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/what-is-blockquick-tm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>BlockQuick algorithm</strong></a>.

Of course, a "diode" is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diode" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>small electrical component</strong></a> that is fundamental to almost every electrical system. Activity on one side of a diode can pass to the other side (electrical current can go in that direction), but typically not vice versa. It is like a one way street for electrical systems, and is often used to safely partition one sub-circuit from another. Although it is reaching a bit, here are some fun parallels between a diode and Diode:
