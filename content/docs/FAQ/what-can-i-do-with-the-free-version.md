The Diode App \_is\_ a free app - you can add a theoretically unlimited number of free collaboration Zones, and use them,  for no cost.  However, if you want to activate certain features in a given Zone, or are using Diode as part of an organization or for commercial purposes, <a href="https://diode.io/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can subscribe to a paid plan</a> for that particular Zone.

Free Zones are made possible by a collaboration with the <a href="https://diode.foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diode Foundation</a> as part of its mission to deliver secure communications to everyone.  Generally speaking, our shared goal with free Zones is to equip individuals, families, and local communities with the means of secure and private communications.
