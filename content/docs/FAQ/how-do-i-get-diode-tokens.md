<br>At the current time, the primary way to get DIODE is to participate in one of the [**Diode Token Bounty Programs**](https://docs.diode.io/docs/faq/active-programs-and-terms/).

In all cases, you need a wallet to receive DIODE - follow the <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/configure-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Configure Metamask</strong></a> article to get going with using the Metamask wallet.
