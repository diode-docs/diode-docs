Please contact us if you are interested in learning more about DIODE. If you would like to get involved with Diode's ecosystem expansion, please check out our [Airlyft campaign for Diode Ambassadors](https://airlyft.one/diode).

In all cases, you need a wallet to receive DIODE - follow the <a href="https://network.docs.diode.io/docs/faq/configure-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Configure Metamask</a> article to get going with using the Metamask wallet.
