The Diode Network is a tunneling network that uses standards-based encryption and methods to create tunnels between any two devices no matter where they are at in the world.

The main communications fabric is comprised of Diode Network Lite Nodes.  These nodes can be created and hosted by anyone, and only require minimal resources. These nodes use one or more blockchain ledgers to lookup network definitions.

Some Diode Network nodes also run full Diode L1 blockchain nodes, in addition to a Lite Node.  These nodes are called "Full Nodes".
