No, the Diode Network is a p2p relay network which transmits the streaming content. In the Pi video example, we were using a shared port to broadcast the video data live to all participants. The blockchain miners help duplicating the content and sending it to as many receivers as needed. So the Raspberry Pi only needs to stream to one client, but the video can be sent to thousands of viewers at the same time.
