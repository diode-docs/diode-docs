<br>The Diode Command Line Interface (CLI) is the easiest way to get up and running with the full power of the <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/wxckuppo9j" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Diode Network</strong></a>. It is a small program that can be installed on Linux, MacOS, or Windows and runs from a terminal window / command line prompt.

The <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/lsr4tkzz8t" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Start Here</strong></a> article has a section on how to get going using the CLI, and the <a href="https://support.diode.io/article/josr6wwh5e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLI Commands</strong></a> article has information about the specific capabilities of the Diode CLI application.

Many of the Use Cases of the Diode Network can be implemented via the Diode CLI - including [**publishing your own Web3 content**](https://support.diode.io/article/k0bjp824av). The Diode CLI implements the [**Blockquick(TM) algorithm**](https://support.diode.io/article/osywoqibv1), which enables anything running it to interact directly with compatible decentralized networks, like the Diode Network.

The github repositority for the CLI is at <a href="https://github.com/diodechain/diode_go_client" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>https://github.com/diodechain/diode_go_client</strong></a>.
