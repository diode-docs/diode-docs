Diode, as a verb, is basically "secure tunneling".  So, you tunnel by first deciding what you want to do and then doing it:

* Securely collaborate: [Download the app](https://diode.io/download/#app) and invite team members
* Publish assets / content world-wide, but off the public Internet: [Download the CLI](https://diode.io/download/#cli) and run it along side your asset with "diode publish"
* Earn rewards for secure traffic: [Download the Network Node](https://diode.io/download/#network) and put it on a VM/device with a static IP address
