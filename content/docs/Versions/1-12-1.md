## Multiple profiles

We now support multiple profiles! This feature allows you to create multiple usernames and choose which username to use for which Zones. This is useful to keep your username isolated to just the Zones you interact with through that account.

This is important if you interact with Zones for work, for personal, or for other purposes - you can have an account that is specific to each of your ecosystems.

## Make invite codes easier to copy

We added a copy icon for each invite code so you can quickly copy a given invite code to the clipboard. Happy inviting!
