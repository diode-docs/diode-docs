## Better team member stats

We've improved the stats you can see on other team members.  In the past, stats were limited to the online/offline state and the number/size of files they had.  We've added additional information, such as OS type and application version to stats so it is easier for IT support and Admins to help a team member who needs support.  Also, the stats shared are now persistent (cached) so you can see them even if the Team Member has gone offline.

You can find stats in each Team Member's Information page by clicking their name in the Team List or in any chat.

## Make invite codes easier to copy

We added a copy icon for each invite code so you can quickly copy a given invite code to the clipboard. Happy inviting!
