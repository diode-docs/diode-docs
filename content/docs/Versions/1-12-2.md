* Features
  * Extend API with polling features
* Bug fixes
  * Chat shows "File does not exist"

## Extend API with polling features

The API has been extended to include channel team and message polling. This allows a remotely connected integration to "catch up" with any messages it may have missed during any outages of the connected peer.

## Fix: Chat shows "File does not exist"

There were two instances where a chat would show the sender that "File does not exist" for files the sender itself had sent. Firstly, this would happen if the chat did not have any files yet in it. Secondly, this would show up on any file added by a non-sync team member until the sender navigated away and then back to the chat again.
